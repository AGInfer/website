!!! info "Synchronous Online Course"
    We also offered a paid option for those who wanted weekly assignments, capstone project, Slack discussion, and certificate of completion.
    **This synchronous option is now full,** but you can enter your email above to be the first to hear about future offerings.

    Those who are enrolled, please [see details](./synchronous).

## Week 1: Fundamentals

The week of February 1, we do a blitz review of the fundamentals of deep learning, and introduce the codebase we will be working on in labs for the remainder of the class.

## Other Resources

[Fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai) is a great free two-course sequence aimed at first getting hackers to train state-of-the-art models as quickly as possible, and only afterward delving into how things work under the hood. Highly recommended for anyone.

[Dive Into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai) is a great free textbook with Jupyter notebooks for every part of deep learning.

[NYU’s Deep Learning](https://atcold.github.io/pytorch-Deep-Learning/) course has excellent PyTorch breakdowns of everything important going on in deep learning.

Stanford’s [ML Systems Design](https://stanford-cs329s.github.io/syllabus.html) course has lectures that parallel those in this course.

[The Batch](https://www.deeplearning.ai/thebatch/) by Andrew Ng is a great weekly update on progress in the deep learning world.

[/r/MachineLearning/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/) is the best community for staying up to date with the latest developments.
