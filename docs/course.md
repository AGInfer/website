## What you will learn

We have taught hundreds of learners in person and thousands online.
We constantly update and improve based on student feedback.

In particular, we've updated all materials with best practices as of 2022, and added brand some brand new topics.

- Formulating the problem and estimating project cost
- Sourcing, cleaning, processing, labeling, and augmenting data
- Picking the right framework and compute infrastructure
- Troubleshooting training and ensuring reproducibility
- Deploying the model at scale
- **âœ¨ Monitoring and continually improving the deployed model âœ¨**
- **âœ¨ How ML teams work and how to manage ML projects âœ¨**
- **âœ¨ Building on Large Language Models and other Foundation Models âœ¨**

## Labs

Through the first few weeks of the course, you will construct an end-to-end ML system, with best practices as of 2022.

- Apply CI/CD principles for clean, fast-moving ML
- Hypermodern training: PyTorch + Lightning + W&B
- Hypermodern deployment: Streamlit + Docker + AWS Lambda + FastAPI

## Who is this for

The course is aimed at people who already understand the basics of deep learning and want to get to know the rest of the stack.

ML Research and Engineers, MS students, software engineers looking to get into ML, and PMs on ML teams will all benefit from materials in our course.

You will get the most out of this course if you have:

- At least one year of experience programming in Python.
- At least one deep learning course (at a university or online).
- Experience with code versioning, Unix environments, and software engineering.

We cover the basics of deep learning (backprop, MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers) in review lectures released before the start of the course â€” but you should not expect to learn this material for the first time from these.
