## What you will learn

Our course incorporates feedback from thousands of learners over 4 years of
teaching students about production machine learning.

In particular, we've updated all materials with best practices as of 2022, and added some brand new topics.

- Formulating the problem and estimating project cost
- Sourcing, cleaning, processing, labeling, synthesizing, and augmenting data
- Picking the right framework and compute infrastructure
- Troubleshooting training and ensuring reproducibility
- Deploying the model at scale
- **âœ¨ Monitoring and continually improving the deployed model âœ¨**
- **âœ¨ How ML teams work and how to manage ML projects âœ¨**
- **âœ¨ Building on Large Language Models and other Foundation Models âœ¨**

## Labs

Through the first few weeks of the course, you will construct an end-to-end ML system, with best practices as of 2022.

- Apply CI/CD principles for clean, fast-moving ML
- Hypermodern training: [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) + [Lightning](https:/pytorchlightning.ai) + [W&B](https://wandb.ai)
- Hypermodern deployment: [Docker](https://docker.com) + [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda) + [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com)

## Project

Once the labs are done, you'll begin working on your own team project.
You'll create a working demo of an ML-powered application and share it with your fellow learners,
including feedback from course staff.

Selected projects will get the opportunity to share their work with the broader community.

## Who is this for

The course is aimed at people who already understand the basics of deep learning and want to get to know the rest of the stack.

ML Researchers and Engineers, MS students, software engineers looking to get into ML, data scientists looking to up their software engineering game, and PMs on ML teams will all benefit from materials in our course.

You will get the most out of this course if you have:

- At least one year of experience programming in Python.
- At least one deep learning course (at a university or online).
- Experience with code versioning, Unix environments, and software engineering.

and can commit at least four hours a week to learning, split across lectures, Q&A, labs, and reading.

We review the fundamentals of deep learning (backprop, MLPs, CNNs, Transformers) in supplementary lectures released before the start of the course â€” but you should not expect to learn this material for the first time from these.
