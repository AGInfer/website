# Full Stack Deep Learning - 2022

<div class="md-banner announce"  markdown>
<h2 style="margin: 16px 10px;"> üöÄ  We are excited to announce our 2022 course, starting August 8! üöÄ </h2>

Lectures, Q&A, private Discord, coding labs, and a portfolio project,<br>
all on making awesome ML products that work IRL<br>
over 10 weeks from August to October.<br>

[Registration opens soon](#register){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

## What you will learn

Our course incorporates feedback from thousands of learners over 4 years of
teaching production machine learning.

We've updated all materials with best practices as of 2022 and added some brand new topics:

- Formulating the problem and estimating project cost
- Sourcing, cleaning, processing, labeling, synthesizing, and augmenting data
- Picking the right framework and compute infrastructure
- Troubleshooting training and ensuring reproducibility
- Deploying the model at scale
- **‚ú® Monitoring and continually improving the deployed model ‚ú®**
- **‚ú® How ML teams work and how to manage ML projects ‚ú®**
- **‚ú® Building on Large Language Models and other Foundation Models ‚ú®**

## Labs

Through the first few weeks of the course, you will construct an end-to-end ML system, with best practices as of 2022.

- Applying CI/CD principles for clean, fast-moving ML
- Hypermodern training: [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) + [Lightning](https:/pytorchlightning.ai) + [W&B](https://wandb.ai)
- Hypermodern deployment: [Docker](https://docker.com) + [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda) + [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com)

## Project

Once the labs are done, you'll begin working on your own portfolio project.
You'll create a working a working ML-powered application of your choice and share it with your fellow learners,
getting feedback from course staff.

Selected projects will get the opportunity to share their work with the broader FSDL community.

## Who is this for

ML Researchers and Engineers,
MS students,
software engineers looking to get into ML,
data scientists looking to up their software engineering game,
and PMs on ML teams will all benefit from materials in our course.

You will get the most out of this course if you have:

- At least one year of experience programming in Python.
- At least one deep learning course (at a university or online).
- Experience with code versioning, Unix environments, and software engineering.
- At least four hours a week to commit to learning, split across lectures, Q&A, labs, reading, and project work.

We review the fundamentals of deep learning (backprop, MLPs, CNNs, Transformers) in supplementary lectures released before the start of the course ‚Äî but you should not expect to learn this material for the first time from these.
