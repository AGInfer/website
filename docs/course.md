#### An interactive 10-week course

Weekly lectures and live Q&A sessions, ongoing discussion on Discord, and capstone project reviewed by peers and staff.

#### Polished by experience

We have taught hundreds of learners in person and thousands online. We constantly update and improve based on student feedback.

#### Best practices as of 2022

- Construct an ML-powered app with guided labs
- Apply CI/CD principles for clean, fast-moving ML
- Hypermodern training: PyTorch + Lightning + W&B
- Hypermodern deployment: Streamlit + Docker + AWS Lambda + FastAPI

## What you will learn

All materials are thoroughly updated for 2022.

- Formulating the problem and estimating project cost
- Sourcing, cleaning, processing, labeling, and augmenting data
- Picking the right framework and compute infrastructure
- Troubleshooting training and ensuring reproducibility
- Deploying the model at scale
- **âœ¨NEWâœ¨** Monitoring and continually improving the deployed model
- **âœ¨NEWâœ¨** How ML teams work and how to manage ML projects
- **âœ¨NEWâœ¨** Building on Large Language Models and other Foundation Models

## Who is this for

The course is aimed at people who already understand the basics of deep learning and want to get to know the rest of the stack.

Currently working ML Research and Engineers, Masterâ€™s Students, Software Engineers looking to get into ML, and PMs on ML teams will all benefit from materials in our course.

You will get the most out of this course if you have:

- At least one year of experience programming in Python.
- At least one deep learning course (at a university or online).
- Experience with code versioning, Unix environments, and software engineering.

We cover the basics of deep learning (backprop, MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers) in review lectures released before the start of the course â€” but you should not expect to learn this material for the first time from these.
