# Synchronous Cohort Option

We're organizing the synchronous cohort for the 2022 course via Discord.

## How do I know if I'm fully registered?

If you completed your registration for the course,
you should be able to access the `#course-announcements` channel
[here](https://discord.com/channels/984525101678612540/999034075853623346).

Please email us at `registration@fullstackdeeplearning.com`
if you registered for the course but cannot access the Discord.

## I've registered and I'm in the Discord. How do I follow along?

Check out the top-level posts in the
`#course-announcements` channel
[here](https://discord.com/channels/984525101678612540/999034075853623346)
for information on content and schedule,
including a calendar link.

## How do I control my notifications in Discord?

To stay apprised of updates without getting overwhelmed, we suggest these notification settings:
![notification settings](https://fsdl.me/notification-settings)

You can find them here in the Discord web client:
![notification-menu](https://fsdl.me/notification-menu)

#### Only course staff can use the remaining notification stream,
@mentions.

If you turn off `@role`/`@everyone`/`@here`, you won't see announcements about live events and changes of schedule.

If you want to further reduce distractions, turn off the [notification dot](https://getonstream.com/what-is-the-red-dot-on-my-discord/).

You can also [mute individual channels](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/209791877-How-do-I-mute-and-disable-notifications-for-specific-channels-), leaving only [`#course-announcements`](https://discord.com/channels/984525101678612540/999034075853623346) off mute.

#### Only instructors can post in the `#course-announcements` channel.

If you furthermore [hide muted channels](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/213599277-How-do-I-hide-muted-channels-), the Discord interface will only show that channel, but you'll miss out on the chance to discover discussions in other channels.
