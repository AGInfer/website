# Labs 1-3: CNNs, Transformers, PyTorch Lightning

As part of Full Stack Deep Learning 2022,
we will incrementally develop a complete deep learning codebase
to create and deploy a model that understands the content of hand-written paragraphs.

For an overview of the Text Recognizer application architecture,
click the badge below to open an interactive Jupyter notebook on Google Colab:

This first set of "review" labs covers
deep learning fundamentals and
introduces some of the core libraries we will use.

While we recommend you read through all of these labs,
we recommend only completing the exercises for the labs
that are of most interest to you.
