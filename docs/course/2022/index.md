## Detailed Contents

### [Lecture 1: Course Vision and When to Use ML][lec1]
We review the purpose of the course and consider when it's a good (or bad!) idea to use ML.
*Published August 8, 2022.*

### [Lab Overview][lab0]
We walk through the entire architecture of the application we will be building, from soup to nuts.
*Published July 25, 2022.*

### [Labs 1-3: CNNs, Transformers, PyTorch Lightning][labs1-3]
We review DNN architectures and work through basic model training with PyTorch + Lightning.
*Published August 10, 2022.*

### [Lecture 2: Development Infrastructure & Tooling][lec2]
We tour the landscape of infrastructure and tooling for developing deep learning models.
*Published August 15, 2022.*

### [Lab 4: Experiment Management][lab4]
We run, track, and manage model development experiments with Weights & Biases.
*Published August 17, 2022.*

### [Lecture 3: Troubleshooting & Testing][lec3]
We look at tools and practices for testing software in general
and ML models in particular.
*Published August 22, 2022.*

### [Lab 5: Troubleshooting & Testing][lab5]
We try out some Python testing tools and dissect a PyTorch trace to
learn performance troubleshooting techniques.
*Published August 24, 2022.*

### [Lecture 4: Data Management][lec4]
We look at sourcing, storing, exploring, processing, labeling, and versioning data for deep learning.
*Published August 29, 2022.*

### [Lab 6: Data Annotation][lab6]
We spin up a data annotation server and learn
just how messy data really is.
*Published August 31, 2022.*

### [Lecture 5: Data Management][lec5]
We do a lightning tour of all the ways models are deployed
and do a deep dive on running models as web services.
*Published September 5, 2022.*

### [Lab 7: Web Deployment][lab7]
We create and deploy our ML-powered
text recognition application
with a simple web UI and a serverless model service.
*Published September 7, 2022.*

### [Lecture 6: Continual Learning][lec6]
We consider what it takes to build a
continual learning system around
an ML-powered application.
*Published September 12, 2022.*

### [Lab 8: Web Deployment][lab8]
We add and review data logged by actual users
of the
[FSDL Text Recognizer](https://fsdl-text-recognizer.ngrok.io).
*Published September 14, 2022.*
