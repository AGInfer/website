## Course

<div class="row" markdown>
  <div markdown>
  Every year, we put together a [course](/course/).
  Several hundred people take it synchronously, participating in lectures, doing labs, and showing their own project at the end.
  Thousands more watch the videos that we post on <a href="https://youtube.com/c/FullStackDeepLearning">YouTube</a>.

  We have taught the course online in [2021](/spring2021), as official [Berkeley](https://bit.ly/berkeleyfsdl) (2021) and [UW](https://bit.ly/uwfsdl) (2020) courses, and as weekend bootcamps in [2019](/march2019) and [2018](/august2018).
