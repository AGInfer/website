## Why

We are in the middle of a **tech tree unlock** as momentous as the early days of the Internet.

The way that AI systems are developed has changed from ‚Äútrain a model from scratch‚Äù to ‚Äúfine-tune an existing model‚Äù to ‚Äúprompt a large foundation model.‚Äù

An entirely new ecosystem of vendors and tools has formed, and even ML veterans are scrambling to orient themselves and figure out the most productive new sets of techniques and tools.

They are asking themselves:

- ‚ÄúShould I be able to code a Transformer from scratch?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúWhat will my moat be if I‚Äôm relying on OpenAI APIs?‚Äù
- "Are there open-source alternatives to LLM vendors?"
- "Can I use human feedback to improve performance?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúDo I need to buy a cluster of A100‚Äôs?‚Äù

## What

We have put together a state-of-the-art program to help you answer these questions and make the transition.

- **AskFullStackAI Sample Project**
    - Well-documented project using LangChain, GPT-3, (Vector DB)
    - Use as starter code to save ~20 hours on your own project

- **Foundations of Foundation Models**
    - Training vs Evaluation, Loss Functions, PR Curves, Common Benchmarks
    - Self-supervised Learning
    - The Transformer, BERT/T5/GPT/RETRO models, Chinchilla Scaling Laws

- **Mastering LLM APIs**
    - The basics (temperature, log probs, byte pair encoding)
    - Vendor comparison (OpenAI, Cohere, AI21, open source models)
    - Prompt Engineering (few-shot examples, dynamic context, chain-of-thought, formatting tricks)
    - Software tools (LangChain, GPTIndex, Everyprompt, dust.tt)

- **Search 2.0**
    - Embeddings and Semantic Search
    - Vector Databases (e.g. FAISS, Milvus, Pinecone, Weaviate, Vespa)
    - Multi-modal search

- **Learning from human feedback**
    - Monitoring predictions and recording feedback
    - RLHF

- **Deploying AI-powered apps**

- **UX Design of AI-powered apps**

## Who

We are Full Stack AI (formerly Full Stack Deep Learning).

Since 2018, we have taught in-person bootcamps, online multi-week cohorts, and official semester-long courses at UW and UC Berkeley.
