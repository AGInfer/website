## Why

We are at the cusp of a technology unlock of a magnitude not seen since the early days of the Internet.
Rapid AI progress is fulfilling the old promise of Language User Interfaces (*LUI*s), which will revolutionize software just as GUIs did in the 90s.

The way AI-powered apps are built is rapidly changing:

- Before LLMs, an idea would bottleneck on training models from scratch, and then it'd bottleneck again on scalable deployment.
- Now an MVP based on pretrained, promptable LLM models and APIs can be configured and serving users in an hour.

An entirely new ecosystem of techniques, tools, and tool vendors is forming around LLMs and LUIs. Even ML veterans are scrambling to orient themselves to what is now possible and figure out the most productive techniques and tools.

## What

We put together a two-day program based on emerging best practices in the LLM community and the latest research results to help you make the transition to building LLM apps with confidence.
We ran that program as an in-person bootcamp in San Francisco on April 21-22.

Now, we're releasing
[the materials for free](spring-2023/),
for everyone!

They include lectures that cover

  - intuition and techniques for [prompt engineering](spring-2023/prompt-engineering/)
  - emerging practices in [LLMOps](spring-2023/llmops/)
  - [user experience design](spring-2023/ux-for-luis) for language user interfaces

and [more](spring-2023/)!

!!! question "What do I need to know already?"
    The lectures aim to get anyone with experience programming in Python ready to start building applications that use LLMs.

    Experience with at least one of machine learning, frontend, or backend will be very helpful.

## Who

We are <a href="https://fullstackdeeplearning.com">Full Stack Deep Learning</a>.
We're a team of UC Berkeley PhD alumni with years of industry experience who are passionate about teaching people how to make deep neural networks work in the real world.

Since 2018, we have taught in-person bootcamps, online multi-week cohorts, and official semester-long courses at top universities.
