## Why

We are at the cusp of a technology unlock of a magnitude not seen since the early days of the Internet.
Rapid AI progress is fulfilling the old promise of Language User Interfaces (*LUI*s), which will revolutionize software just as GUIs did in the 90s.

The way AI-powered apps are built is rapidly changing:

- Before LLMs, an idea would bottleneck on training models from scratch, and then it'd bottleneck again on scalable deployment.
- Now an MVP based on pretrained, promptable LLM models and APIs can be configured and serving users in an hour.

An entirely new ecosystem of techniques, tools, and tool vendors is forming around LLMs and LUIs. Even ML veterans are scrambling to orient themselves to what is now possible and figure out the most productive techniques and tools.

## What

We're releasing the lecture materials from our
[in-person LLM bootcamp](./april-2023/)
for free, for everyone!
We'll be posting them on
[our YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/@FullStackDeepLearning)
over the coming weeks.

We'd like to use this opportunity to bring
together people who are interested in building LLM-powered apps.
And while there are lots of in-person one-day hackathons,
there are fewer opportunities to work on projects
online and over the course of multiple days or weeks.

So if you're interested in building an LLM app and
getting feedback from experts,
join our [project cohort](#register)!
You'll get:

- Immediate access to the lecture videos when the course starts
- Compute credits, including $50 for the OpenAI API, to help you get your app off the ground
- Developer access to ChatGPT plugins
- Access to a private Discord, weekly Q&A sessions, and office hours

We think the best software is built by teams,
so we're encouraging cohort members to form groups to work on their projects.
If you already have a team of three or more,
[fill out this form](https://fsdl.me/llmbc-online-teams)
for a 10% discount on registration!

!!! question "What do I need to know already?"
    The lectures aim to get anyone with experience programming in Python ready to start building applications that use LLMs.

    Experience with at least one of machine learning, frontend, or backend will be very helpful.

    If you want to participate in the project cohort,
    you should either be comfortable with building the stack your project requires
    or willing to contribute your specific skills to a team.
